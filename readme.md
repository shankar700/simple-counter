# Brainstorm Mode: Counter App
In this mode, we identified and discussed the features and enhancements we wanted for our counter app. We started with the basic idea of a counter that could be incremented and decremented. As the brainstorming session progressed, we decided to enhance the app by adding a reset button, allowing users to reset the counter to zero.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Feature Identification:**
   - Identify the primary feature: a counter that can be incremented and decremented.
2. **Feature Enhancement:**
   - Discuss and suggest additional features like a reset button for enhanced usability.

# Logic Mode: Counter App
In the Logic Mode, we established the core logic for the counter app. We defined the functionality for incrementing, decrementing, and resetting the counter. This phase focused on the algorithmic and functional aspects of the app without delving into specific technologies.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Increment Logic:**
   - Define the logic for increasing the counter.
2. **Decrement Logic:**
   - Define the logic for decreasing the counter.
3. **Reset Logic:**
   - Define the logic for resetting the counter to zero.

# Build Mode: Counter App
During the Build Mode, we implemented the app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We created the structure of the app, applied styles for a pleasing interface, and integrated the logic defined earlier. The focus here was on transforming the logic into a functional and visually appealing web application.

**Key Steps:**
1. **HTML Structure:**
   - Develop the HTML structure for the counter app, including the counter display and buttons.
2. **CSS Styling:**
   - Apply styles to the HTML elements for a visually appealing layout.
3. **JavaScript Functionality:**
   - Implement the increment, decrement, and reset functionality using JavaScript.

# Design Mode: Counter App
In Design Mode, we focused on improving the user interface (UI) and overall design of the app. This included selecting suitable fonts, colors, and layouts to enhance the user experience and make the app aesthetically pleasing.

**Key Steps:**
1. **UI Styling:**
   - Work on the UI design, including fonts, colors, and overall layout adjustments.
2. **Button Styling:**
   - Style the buttons to ensure they are visually appealing and intuitive.
